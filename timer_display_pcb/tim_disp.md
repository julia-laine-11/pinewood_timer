## Timer displays
I had previously made this circuit in a class so I just reused the schematic. There is a lot more happening on the board then I would have for this project.

### Parts
4x TDCR1050M - 7-seg displays
16x PN2907A - cathode select bjt
16x 150 Ohm - mux to bjt
16x 47 Ohm - driver to display
2x 74HC138 - mux
2x TLC59211 - driver
